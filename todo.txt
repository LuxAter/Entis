Wait event receving continuous events of (NO_EVENT) or (NO_EXPOSE)? THis is
causing a large strain on the system.
  Solved by just not displaying on calls to NO_EXPOSE, the calling display on
  no expose caused a lot of extra work.

Reimplement entis event, so that we are able to determin key code at event
parse time.
